            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E=mcÂ², which has become a symbol of the scientific revolution.</p>
            <p>Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein's work has had a profound impact on the way we understand time, space, and gravity. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a crucial step in the development of quantum theory.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Relativity</h2>
            <p>The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental theory in physics that revolutionized our understanding of space and time. It consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity introduced the idea that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion, and showed that light travels at a constant speed.</p>
            <p>General relativity expanded on this, describing gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass. This theory has been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations, including the bending of light around massive objects and the discovery of gravitational waves.</p>

            <h2>Photoelectric Effect</h2>
            <p>The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when it is exposed to light. Einstein's explanation of this effect provided crucial evidence for the quantum nature of light, leading to the development of quantum mechanics. His work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</p>
            <p>In essence, Einstein showed that light can be thought of as both a wave and a particle, which was a groundbreaking concept at the time.</p>

            <h2>Unified Field Theory</h2>
            <p>Einstein's unified field theory is an attempt to describe all fundamental forces of nature within a single theoretical framework. Although he was never able to fully formulate this theory, it represents a significant effort to unify the gravitational force with electromagnetism.</p>
            <p>His pursuit of a unified field theory reflects his belief in the interconnectedness of all physical phenomena and his quest to find a simple, elegant explanation for the workings of the universe.</p>
